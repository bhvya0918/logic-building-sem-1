Logic Building — Problem Solving with C

A collection of beginner-friendly C programs designed to strengthen core programming logic. This repository includes small, structured exercises that focus on loops, conditionals, operators, arrays, strings, and pointers.

The goal of this project is to improve step-by-step thinking, understand how code flows, and build confidence in writing clean and efficient solutions. Each program is written in simple C, making it easy for beginners to read, modify, and learn from.

What this repo includes:

Basic input/output practice

If–else and nested conditions

Loop-based problems (for, while, do-while)

Pattern printing

Array & string manipulation

Pointer-based logic questions

Mini assignments for viva preparation
